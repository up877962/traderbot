# traderbot
a cryptocurrency trading bot and interface built around the Coinbase python API library developed on windows but intended to run on a raspberry Pi once fully functional

Please note the keys.txt file is provided empty, use either the public API keys available at coinbasePro.com or use your own keys for full functionality insert keys each on a new line with the public key on line one then secret key then the passphrase.

This program is in the very early days of development as such use at your own risk.

Will not run on python 3+ , tested and works on python 2.7.x this is due to the API library and beyond my control.
